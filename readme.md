# TwitchBot

This is just a small twitch bot I created. It contains some common handlers.

This bot has a bunch of fun stuff installed. Check out the handlers folder for the files that perform certain actions.  The main.js file loads in the handlers. 

# Startup

 - First, have the latest NodeJS installed.
 - Run `npm i`.
 - Create a `.env` file and add your `API_KEY` value.  It should look like this:

 ```
API_KEY=oauth:<rest of twitch api key>
 ```

 - Run `npm start`
